Flet is a framework that enables you to easily build real-time web, mobile, and desktop apps in your favorite language and securely share them with your team. No frontend experience is required.

### ⚡From idea to app in minutes

An internal tool or a dashboard for your team, weekend project, data entry form, kiosk app, or high-fidelity prototype - Flet is an ideal framework to quickly hack great-looking interactive apps to serve a group of users.

### 📐 Simple architecture

No more complex architecture with JavaScript frontend, REST API backend, database, cache, etc. With Flet you just write a monolith stateful app in Python only and get multi-user, real-time Single-Page Application (SPA).
